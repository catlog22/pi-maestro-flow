---

<purpose>
Structured second-opinion on code, decisions, or plans via three modes: review (3 parallel agents),
challenge (adversarial), or consult (interactive Q&A). Findings persist to learnings.md.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — target and optional mode flag.

**Target resolution** (auto-detected):
| Input | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| File path | Read file content |
| Wiki ID (`<type>-<slug>`) | `maestro wiki get <id>` |
| `HEAD` / `staged` | `git diff HEAD` / `git diff --staged` |
| Phase number | Resolve via state.json.artifacts[] → plan.json |

**Flags**:
- `--mode review|challenge|consult` (default: review)
- `-y`: Skip confirmation prompts for knowhow/spec writes

**Pre-load** (optional): `Skill("spec-load")` for conventions + `maestro search "<target topic>"` for related entries.

**Output**: `.workflow/knowhow/KNW-opinion-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `.workflow/knowhow/KNW-opinion-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` and `.workflow/specs/learnings.md` only. NEVER modify source code or files outside these paths.
</context>

<invariants>
1. **Read-only analysis** — NEVER modify source code, wiki entries, or plan files under review; all writes go to `.workflow/` only
2. **Agent independence** — in review mode, each of the 3 agents (Pragmatist/Purist/Strategist) MUST operate independently without shared state; NEVER pass one agent's findings to another
3. **Evidence-backed verdicts** — every finding MUST include a `location` reference (file:line or section); ungrounded opinions SHALL NOT appear in the report
4. **Mode contract** — MUST execute exactly the mode specified (review/challenge/consult); NEVER mix mode behaviors within a single execution
5. **Append-only learnings** — `.workflow/specs/learnings.md` MUST be appended, NEVER overwritten or truncated
6. **Confirmation gate** — unless `-y` is set, MUST present findings and target files via user prompt before any writes
</invariants>

### A_REVIEW
Spawn 3 Agents in single message:

| Agent | Focus | Question |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Pragmatist | simplicity, YAGNI, maintenance | "Simplest thing that works? Maintenance burden?" |
| Purist | correctness, edge cases, type safety | "What assumptions can be violated?" |
| Strategist | scalability, architecture alignment | "Supports future growth? Fits architecture?" |

Each returns: persona, verdict (approve/concern/reject), confidence, findings[{severity, description, location, suggestion}], summary.

### A_CHALLENGE
Spawn 1 adversarial Agent:
- Find weakest assumption
- Propose concrete breaking scenario
- Identify single biggest risk
- Suggest alternative approach
- Apply forcing questions: "What invalidates this?", "Simplest thing that breaks this?", "What would you regret in 6 months?", "What implicit contract isn't enforced?"

### A_CONSULT
Interactive loop:
1. Agent studies target
2. Display "Target loaded. What would you like to know?"
3. user prompt → Agent answers with code refs → repeat until "done"
4. Compile Q&A into report

| Code | Condition | Recovery |
|------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | No target provided | Prompt user for target (path, wiki ID, HEAD, staged, or phase) |
| E002 | Unknown --mode value | Use: review, challenge, or consult |
| E003 | Target resolution failed — path not found, wiki ID invalid, or no staged changes | Check target exists |
| W001 | One review agent failed | Proceed with available perspectives |
| W002 | Specs/wiki pre-load unavailable | Proceed without convention context; note reduced coverage |
