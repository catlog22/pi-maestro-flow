- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

<purpose>
Intent-driven knowledge-store management. No fixed grammar — state your intent; the command classifies it and runs the matching workflow or direct lifecycle command. Explicit keywords still work as deterministic shortcuts.

| Operation | Keywords | Execution document or CLI |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| audit | `audit` / 审计 / 检查知识库 | `maestro knowledge audit --scope all`（只读；细节见 `~/.maestro/workflows/knowledge-audit.md`） |
| normalize | `normalize` / `migrate` / 规范化 / 迁移 | `maestro knowledge normalize --report <path>`，审阅后才可原样追加 `--apply` |
| review | `review` / 审查 / 证据 / 下一步 / 匹配 / 去重 / 冲突检测 / 裁决 / 候选 / backlog | `maestro knowledge review <session-id> [--refresh] --json` → shared presentation/authorization |
| stage | `stage` / 暂存 / candidate / 沉淀候选 / cited / validated / contradicted / 记录命中关系 | `maestro knowledge stage ... [--signal <signal> --signal-ids <ids>]` |
| promote | `promote` / 晋升 / 发布候选 | Shared closeout protocol → `maestro knowledge promote <session-id> --candidate <approved-id>` |
| harvest | `harvest` / 提取 / 收割 / 从工件 | `~/.maestro/workflows/harvest.md` |
| wiki | `wiki` / 知识图谱 / 连接 / 摘要 / 健康 | `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-manage.md` / `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-connect.md` / `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-digest.md` |
| extractors | `extractors` / 抽取器 / 生成抽取规则 | `~/.maestro/workflows/extractors.md` |
| domain | `domain` / 领域术语 / 注册术语 / term | `~/.maestro/workflows/domain-add.md` |
</purpose>

<dispatch>
Classify the intent in `$ARGUMENTS` into one operation. For an operation mapped to an execution document, read the path shown in the table directly and follow it; do not create a Session or Run merely to load instructions. For direct lifecycle operations, invoke the listed `maestro knowledge` CLI command.

1. Explicit keyword present → use its execution document or direct CLI lifecycle command (deterministic shortcut).
2. Otherwise infer from the intent (see the table above), e.g. "审计/检查知识库" → audit, "从工件/session 提取" → harvest, "知识图谱/wiki 健康" → wiki, "注册术语 X" → domain.
3. `review` / `stage` / `promote` use the corresponding `maestro knowledge` CLI. For candidate closeout, follow `~/.maestro/ref/knowledge-closeout.md` (Review → Refresh → Present → Authorize → Execute → Verify), not an unreviewed direct mutation: review-only stays read-only; refresh only missing/stale receipts within authority; after confirming the disposition and any resulting publication, use `promote --resolve`; publish already eligible fixed explicitly approved IDs via `promote --candidate`. `stage --signal --signal-ids` includes signal recording. Preserve stable knowledge IDs, graph aliases, Run ID, Session ID, signal, candidate ID, disposition, target, and reason exactly; do not translate these operations into direct spec/knowhow writes.
4. For wiki, classify the sub-action: `connect`/连接 → `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-connect.md`; `digest`/摘要 → `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-digest.md`; `health`/`search`/`cleanup`/`stats`/健康/检查/_(none)_ → `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-manage.md`.
5. Ambiguous → display the operation table and ask the user to pick.

### Routing rules

- Remaining tokens after classification become the chosen step's own arguments.
- During an active Run, reusable knowhow is staged here with `maestro knowledge stage knowhow ...`; project knowhow is written only by explicit promotion. Outside a Run, direct `/maestro-knowhow` capture remains available.
- Minimal canonical creation surfaces are deliberately small: ordinary Knowhow is exactly `maestro knowhow add --type <type> --title "<title>" --content-file <path>`; ordinary Spec is exactly `maestro spec add <category> "<title>" "<content>"`. Keywords, sourceRef, relatedPaths, applicability, language, decision state, ID, and tool flags are advanced optional metadata—not required creation parameters. The nine Knowhow types remain `session|tip|template|recipe|reference|decision|asset|blueprint|document`.
- Outside any Run entirely (no Run to bind), the minimal Knowhow command is the fast path: it writes `.workflow/knowhow/` directly with no Session, `--evidence`, or review/promote cycle. Reserve `stage → review → promote` for candidates needing corpus adjudication.
- Repository authority is host-owned. Omit `targetRepoId` for an ordinary current-repository write. Pass it only for an explicitly selected linked physical write after the host supplied that target's exact stable UUID and a live write capability for the matching corpus. The value must equal that host-supplied UUID; never infer it from cwd, repository name, alias, or path, and never persist alias/path as identity. If explicit linked authority is absent, fail closed instead of guessing.
- `maestro knowledge audit` is always read-only. Its only scopes are `spec|knowhow|all`; pipeline/repository diagnostics always run, usage diagnostics run when MaestroGraph exists, and `--prune` only includes a deterministic `prune_plan`. Audit has no `--apply`, mutation, delete, or purge path. Compatibility normalization never happens during audit. First save `maestro knowledge normalize --report <path>`, review it, then run that same report path with `--apply`; changed sources or repository identity invalidate the report.
- Stage candidate content from a temp file or stdin, never inline: write the content to a file and pass `maestro knowledge stage <target> "<title>" --content-file <path|->`. Inline positional content containing spaces, quotes, unicode (e.g. `…`), newlines, or leading dashes is misparsed and shifts later arguments.
- `--signal-ids` takes comma-separated IDs (`--signal-ids spec:project:a,knowhow:b`); space-separated values leak into positional arguments and corrupt the stage call.
- Use `maestro knowledge review <session-id> --json` as the closeout review surface. It shows fresh/missing/stale receipts and diversified evidence-backed matches. The shared protocol governs presentation, human authorization, inline `promote --resolve`, selected `promote --candidate`, and result/review readback; copyable commands alone are not owner closeout. `review --resolve` remains the deprecated compatibility fallback, including relationship-only adjudication without publication approval.
- Reconciliation is mandatory before completion but is not a popularity vote: exact identity, diversified semantic matches, and recorded/KG associations are evaluated separately. Unresolved semantic duplicate/conflict/supersession candidates may be sealed, but promotion must fail closed until the relationship is explicitly confirmed and resolved via `promote --resolve` (or the deprecated `review --resolve` fallback).
- Agent closeout uses fixed approved candidate IDs, never `-y` or `--all` as publication approval. Zero candidates, rejection, or deferral leave backlog intact and permit otherwise valid completion; no question tool and no explicit authorization means defer.
- Promotion requires eligible candidates with fresh receipts. Run-source candidates require every source Run sealed. A canonical `session/3.0` session-source candidate does not require Session completion: it requires immutable candidate version/content hash, bound Session identity/revision (later unrelated Session activity alone does not invalidate the snapshot), non-empty evidence roots/hash, and a fresh session reconciliation receipt for the candidate snapshot and current corpus fingerprint, revalidated at final commit. Normal Run/Session completion never implies approval or promotion. Older schema rules belong only to explicitly selected legacy compatibility.
- Treat audit findings and prune suggestions as evidence only. Never translate them into automatic lifecycle changes, and never prune solely because knowledge has low usage.
