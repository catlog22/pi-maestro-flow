<purpose>
Extract knowledge from workflow artifacts → route to wiki/spec/issue stores. Works on any artifact (vs retrospective which is phase-scoped).

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Modes (auto-detected):**
- No arguments → `scan` mode: discover all harvestable artifacts, interactive selection
- `<session-id>` (e.g., `ANL-auth-20260410`, `WFS-xxx`) → `session` mode: harvest specific session
- `<path>` (e.g., `.workflow/.analysis/ANL-auth-20260410/`) → `path` mode: harvest from explicit directory

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes` — Skip confirmation prompts for all write operations (artifact selection, routing decisions, store writes). Useful for CI or batch harvesting.

Additional flags, source registry (scan paths), and storage locations defined in workflow harvest.md.

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `.workflow/knowhow/`, `.workflow/specs/`, `.workflow/issues/`, `.workflow/wiki/`, `.workflow/harvest/`, or `.workflow/state.json` only. NEVER modify source code, source artifacts, or files outside these paths.
</context>

<invariants>
1. **Read-only until routing** — extraction and classification happen in-memory; no files written until Stage 6
2. **Never modify source artifacts** — harvest is purely extractive; source files remain untouched
3. **Dedup before write** — MUST check harvest-log.jsonl and existing stores before each write to prevent duplicates
4. **Source tagging** — MUST set `source: "harvest"` on every issues.jsonl row so concurrent writers can be distinguished
5. **Relationship pre-check on spec routing** — when routing to spec, MUST compare against existing specs with same keywords/category. Classify the relationship: **supersede** (new replaces old) → attach `supersedes = <old-sid>`, after add run `maestro spec supersede`; **conflict** (genuine dispute) → set `confidence="low"` and log conflict note; **independent** → no metadata
6. **Provenance tracking** — every routed item MUST be logged in harvest-log.jsonl with fragment ID, target store, and timestamp
7. **Dry-run safety** — `--dry-run` MUST NOT write any files; preview only
</invariants>

<execution>
Follow '~/.pi/agent/packages/pi-maestro-flow/workflows/harvest.md' Stages 1-8 in order.

### Phase Gates (MANDATORY, BLOCKING)

**GATE 1: Discovery → Extraction** (Stages 1-3 → Stage 4)
- REQUIRED: Source artifacts discovered and mode resolved (scan/session/path).
- REQUIRED: User selected artifact(s) to harvest (or auto-selected via session/path mode, or `-y`).
- BLOCKED if no harvestable artifacts found (W001) or invalid source (E004/E005).

**GATE 2: Extraction → Routing** (Stage 4 → Stage 5-6)
- REQUIRED: All files in selected artifacts loaded and parsed.
- REQUIRED: Knowledge fragments extracted with category, confidence, and tags.
- REQUIRED: Fragments filtered by `--min-confidence`.
- BLOCKED if extraction produces zero fragments.

**GATE 3: Routing → Write** (Stage 6 → Stage 7-8)
- REQUIRED: Routing classification applied (auto or forced by `--to`).
- REQUIRED: Dedup check passed against harvest-log.jsonl and existing stores.
- REQUIRED: If `--dry-run`: preview displayed, no files written — GATE blocks further writes.
- BLOCKED if dedup check fails or store paths unresolvable.

Extraction patterns, classification rules, routing infrastructure, and fragment ID scheme defined in workflow harvest.md.

### Next-step routing

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Wiki entries created | `maestro wiki list --type note` |
| Wiki graph needs linking | `/manage-wiki connect --fix` |
| Issues created | `/manage-issue list --source harvest` |
| Specs extracted | `maestro load --type spec` |
| Specs extracted (审查) | `/manage-knowledge-audit --scope spec` — 新写入的 spec 可能与现有条目矛盾或替代 |
| 查看演化链 | `maestro spec history <sid>` — 确认 supersede 链完整 |
| Spec 冲突标记已存在 | `maestro spec conflict list` — 查看当前冲突状态 |
| 知识健康检查 | `maestro spec health` — 悬空/循环 supersedes 校验 |
| Full phase retrospective | `/quality-retrospective` |

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | `.workflow/` not initialized | Run `/maestro-init` first |
| E002 | error | Invalid `--to` target (must be: wiki, spec, issue, auto) | Display valid options |
| E003 | error | Invalid `--source` type | Display valid source types from registry |
| E004 | error | Session ID not found in any source path | Show available sessions with `--source all` |
| E005 | error | Path does not exist or contains no parseable artifacts | Verify path and file structure |
| W001 | warning | No harvestable artifacts found within `--recent` window | Widen time window or check `.workflow/` contents |
| W002 | warning | `maestro wiki create` failed — wiki entries saved to `.workflow/harvest/wiki-pending-*.md` | Apply pending entries manually or retry |
| W003 | warning | Some fragments below confidence threshold — logged but not routed | Lower `--min-confidence` to include |
| W004 | warning | Duplicate fragments skipped | Review harvest-log.jsonl for prior routing |
| W005 | warning | `.workflow/issues/` directory missing | Auto-create directory and empty issues.jsonl |
