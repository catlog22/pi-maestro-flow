<purpose>
Post-execution retrospective (复盘): four parallel lenses (technical/process/quality/decision) → distill insights → route to spec/knowhow/issue stores.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Flags:**
- `-y` — Skip confirmation prompts for external writes (issues.jsonl, spec entries, knowhow capture)
- `--no-route` — Skip routing stage (produce retrospective files only, no spec/issue/knowhow writes)
- `--compare N` — Compare current phase retrospective against phase N (requires single phase argument)
- `--all` — Run retrospective on all completed phases that lack retrospective.json
- `--lens <name>` — Restrict to specific lens (technical|process|quality|decision); default: all four

Modes (scan/single/range/all) and storage paths defined in workflow retrospective.md Argument Shape and Stages 1-7.

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target the phase's retrospective directory (`.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-retrospective-P{N}/`), `.workflow/state.json`, `.workflow/issues.jsonl`, or `.workflow/specs/` (append-only). NEVER modify source code, verification.json, review.json, plan.json, or other existing artifacts.
</context>

<invariants>
1. **Source artifacts are read-only** — NEVER modify verification.json, review.json, plan.json, or any execution artifact. Retrospective reads these for analysis only.
2. **Stable insight IDs** — `INS-{8hex}` MUST be deterministic from `hash(phase_num + lens + title)`. Re-runs MUST NOT create duplicate insights.
3. **Routing requires confirmation** — unless `-y` flag is set, every external write (issues.jsonl, spec entry, knowhow capture) MUST be confirmed by user before execution.
4. **Lens independence** — each lens agent (technical/process/quality/decision) operates independently. One lens's findings MUST NOT suppress or override another's.
5. **Append-only for specs** — learnings.md entries are appended as `<spec-entry>` blocks. NEVER overwrite or restructure existing entries.
6. **Archive before overwrite** — if retrospective.json already exists for a phase, the existing file MUST be archived before writing a new version.
</invariants>

<execution>
Follow `~/.pi/agent/packages/pi-maestro-flow/workflows/retrospective.md` Stages 1–8 in order.

### Phase Gates (MANDATORY, BLOCKING)

**GATE 1: Input → Lens Analysis** (Stages 1-3 → Stage 4)
- REQUIRED: Mode resolved (scan/single/range/all) and phases validated.
- REQUIRED: At least one phase selected with status=completed and existing artifacts.
- REQUIRED: Read-only — no file writes in Stages 1-3.
- BLOCKED if no valid phases: E004/E005.

**GATE 2: Lens Analysis → Routing** (Stages 4-5 → Stage 6)
- REQUIRED: All requested lens agents returned valid JSON (or W001 logged for partial).
- REQUIRED: Insights distilled with stable `INS-{8hex}` IDs.
- REQUIRED: Archive existing `retrospective.{md,json}` before overwrite.
- BLOCKED if all lens agents failed: cannot synthesize without results.

**GATE 3: Routing → Completion** (Stage 6 → Stages 7-8)
- REQUIRED: `retrospective.json` written with metrics, findings, insights, routing.
- REQUIRED: `retrospective.md` written (human-readable).
- REQUIRED: Issue rows match canonical `issues.jsonl` schema (status "open", full fields).
- REQUIRED: Note tips routed via `invoke /skill: "manage-knowhow-capture", args: "tip ..." })`.
- REQUIRED: Unless `-y` flag is set, confirm before each external write (issues.jsonl append, spec-entry append, knowhow-capture). With `-y`, skip all confirmation prompts.
- BLOCKED if routing incomplete: finish all write operations before reporting.

### Execution Constraints

- **Parallel lens dispatch**: Stage 4 spawns one Agent per active lens in a single message.
- **Stable IDs**: `INS-{8 hex}` from `hash(phase_num + lens + title)` — re-runs do not duplicate.
- **No source modification**: Never modify verification.json, review.json, plan.json.
- **Backward-compat**: Append to `.workflow/specs/learnings.md` only if file already exists.

<completion>
### Standalone report

```
--- COMPLETION STATUS ---
STATUS: DONE|DONE_WITH_CONCERNS
CONCERNS: {description if applicable}
--- END STATUS ---
```

### Ralph-invoked completion

End the step by calling the CLI (no text block output):
```
maestro ralph complete <idx> --status {STATUS} [--evidence {path}]
```

### Next-step routing

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Insights routed | `/manage-status` |
| Issues created | `/manage-issue list --source retrospective` |
| Knowhow captured | `/manage-knowhow list` |
| More phases to review | `/quality-retrospective --all` |
</completion>
