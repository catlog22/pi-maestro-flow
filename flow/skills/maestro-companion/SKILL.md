---

<purpose>
Side-car utility for any task: load knowledge context (before), record structured entries (note),
promote insights to spec/knowhow (after), or route to next command (route).
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — mode + optional flags.

**Mode detection priority:**
1. Explicit `before` / `note` / `after` / `route`
2. Intent text that is not a mode keyword → `route`
3. No arguments → auto-detect (`git status` has changes → `after`, else → `before`)

**Flags:**
- `--task <description>` — Current task description (for targeted knowledge loading and doc title)
- `--type <task_type>` — Task type for field template selection (see task types below)
- `--category <cat>` — Spec category filter: coding / arch / test / review / debug / learning / ui

**Task types** (determines which recording sections are active):

| Type | Description | Key sections |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `implement` | Feature development, code writing | working_files, dependencies, decisions, tests_affected |
| `debug` | Bug investigation, root cause analysis | symptoms, hypotheses, evidence, root_cause, fix_applied |
| `analyze` | Code/architecture/performance analysis | scope, findings, risks, recommendations |
| `design` | Architecture/UI/API design | constraints, alternatives, trade_offs, chosen_approach |
| `plan` | Task decomposition, roadmap planning | goals, breakdown, estimates, dependencies |
| `review` | Code review, PR review | files_reviewed, findings, severity_counts, verdict |
| `test` | Test writing, UAT, coverage expansion | coverage_before, coverage_after, gaps, test_files |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, tech debt | affected_modules, before_after, breaking_changes |
| `learn` | Codebase exploration, knowledge building | questions, answers, mental_model, references |
| `general` | Default / unclassified | (all universal sections) |

Auto-detection: if `--type` not provided, infer from `--task` description keywords.

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `.workflow/.scratchpad/` (companion docs + `.companion-active` pointer) only. Promotion writes (spec/knowhow) are delegated to `spec-add` / `manage-knowhow-capture` skills. NEVER modify source code, `.workflow/state.json`, or files outside `.workflow/.scratchpad/`.

**Companion document:**
- Path: `.workflow/.scratchpad/companion-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.md`
- Active doc tracking: `.workflow/.scratchpad/.companion-active` (stores path of current companion doc)
- Format: YAML frontmatter (rich metadata) + typed sections + timestamped entries
</context>

<invariants>
1. **No session creation** — companion NEVER creates workflow sessions, NEVER writes to state.json
2. **Side-car only** — companion MUST NOT modify source code or execute implementation tasks; it is strictly a knowledge loading + recording utility
3. **One active doc** — only one `.companion-active` pointer SHALL exist at a time; creating a new companion doc MUST clear any stale pointer
4. **Append-only entries** — note mode MUST append entries; NEVER overwrite or reorder existing entries
5. **Promotion via delegation** — spec/knowhow promotion MUST route through `spec-add` / `manage-knowhow-capture` skills; companion NEVER writes directly to `.workflow/specs/` or `.workflow/knowhow/`
6. **Type-template integrity** — context template sections MUST match the resolved `task_type`; NEVER mix templates from different types
</invariants>

<execution>

## S_BEFORE — Knowledge Loading + Companion Doc Creation

Execute in order, skip unavailable steps:

### 1. Load specs

```bash
# With --category: load by category
maestro load --type spec --category <cat>

# With --task: load by keyword extracted from task description
maestro load --type spec --keyword <extracted_keyword>

# No flags: load coding (most universal)
maestro load --type spec --category coding
```

Display loaded rules summary (entry count + key rule names).

### 2. Browse knowhow index

```bash
# List recent knowhow entries
maestro knowhow list --store workflow

# With --task: search relevant entries
maestro search --type knowhow "<task_keyword>"
```

Display available knowhow entries (ID + title). Hint: `maestro load --type knowhow --id <id>` for details.

### 3. Check codebase index

```bash
ls .workflow/codebase/doc-index.json
```

- Exists → display "Codebase docs ready, last updated: {timestamp}"
- Missing → suggest `/manage-codebase-rebuild`
- Stale (>7 days) → suggest `/quality-sync`

### 4. Create companion document

Create `.workflow/.scratchpad/` if needed. Resolve task type from `--type` flag or infer from `--task` keywords.

Write companion doc with the full field template:

```markdown
---
# === Identity ===
task: "{task_description or 'Untitled task'}"
task_type: "{resolved type: implement|debug|analyze|design|plan|review|test|refactor|learn|general}"
created: "{ISO timestamp}"
status: active

# === Context Loaded ===
specs_loaded: "{category or 'coding'}"
specs_count: {N}
knowhow_searched: "{keyword or 'none'}"
knowhow_available: {M}
codebase_index: "{ready|missing|stale}"
branch: "{current git branch}"
phase: "{current phase from state.json or 'none'}"
milestone: "{current milestone from state.json or 'none'}"

# === Scope ===
working_files: []
dependencies: []
related_artifacts: []

# === Outcome (populated by after mode) ===
outcome: ""
files_changed: []
promoted_specs: 0
promoted_knowhow: 0
follow_up: []
completed: ""
---

# Companion Doc — {task_description}

> `/maestro-companion note "<content>"` — add entries
> `/maestro-companion after` — review, promote, close

  Knowhow:  {M} entries available
  Codebase: {status}
  Doc:      {companion_doc_path} [{task_type}]

Mid-task commands:
  /maestro-companion note "finding or decision"
  /maestro-companion note --file src/auth.ts "changed token validation"
  /spec-load --keyword <keyword>
  maestro search "<query>"
```

---

## S_NOTE — Append Structured Entry to Companion Doc

### 1. Locate active companion doc

Read `.workflow/.scratchpad/.companion-active` to get the doc path.
If missing or file not found → create a new companion doc (same as S_BEFORE step 4, minimal — no spec/knowhow loading).

### 2. Parse entry content and flags

Parse $ARGUMENTS after `note` keyword:
- `--file <path>` — associate entry with a specific file (appended to frontmatter `working_files`)
- `--severity <level>` — for findings: critical / high / medium / low
- Remaining text = entry content

### 3. Classify entry type

Auto-classify from content signals:

| Content signal | Type tag |
|---------------|----------|
| "decided/decision/chose/picked/went with" | `decision` |
| "pattern/convention/rule/always/never/must" | `spec-candidate` |
| "pitfall/gotcha/careful/warning/trap/beware" | `pitfall` |
| "learned/realized/discovered/understood/turns out" | `insight` |
| "hypothesis/suspect/might be/could be" | `hypothesis` |
| "found bug/root cause/because of/caused by" | `evidence` |
| "risk/concern/worry/might break" | `risk` |
| "todo/need to/should also/follow up/remaining" | `todo` |
| "question/why does/how does/unclear" | `question` |
| "blocked/stuck/can't/impossible" | `blocker` |
| Default | `note` |

### 4. Append entry

Append to the companion doc under `## Entries`:

```markdown
### [{type}] {HH:mm} — {first line of content}

{full content}

{if --file: **File:** `{path}`}
{if --severity: **Severity:** {level}}
```

### 5. Update frontmatter fields

- If `--file` provided and not already in `working_files` → append to `working_files`
- If type is `decision` → also append row to `### Decisions` table (if implement/design type doc)
- If type is `hypothesis` → also append row to `### Hypotheses` table (if debug type doc)
- If type is `evidence` → also append row to `### Evidence Trail` table (if debug type doc)
- If type is `risk` → also append to `### Risks` list (if analyze/design type doc)
- If type is `question` → also append row to `### Questions` table (if learn type doc)

### 6. Confirm

```
[{type}] entry added to companion doc
  /maestro-companion note "..."  — add more
  /maestro-companion after       — review & promote
```

---

## S_AFTER — Review Companion Doc + Populate Outcome + Promote Entries + Route

### 1. Load companion doc

Read `.workflow/.scratchpad/.companion-active` → read the companion doc.
If no active doc or doc is empty → skip to step 4 (accumulation reminder).

### 2. Populate outcome fields

Collect task outcome data:

```bash
# Detect files changed since companion doc creation
# Use git log --since for time-based filtering, then git diff for the range
git log --since="{companion_created_timestamp}" --format="%H" -1  # get oldest commit in range
git diff --name-only {oldest_commit}..HEAD                         # diff from that commit to HEAD
# Fallback if no commits since timestamp: git diff --name-only HEAD
```

Update frontmatter:
- `files_changed` — from git diff
- `completed` — current ISO timestamp
- `status` — `completed`

Display entry summary:
```
Companion doc review — {task_type}
  Entries:    {total} ({by type breakdown})
  Files:      {files_changed count} changed
  Duration:   {elapsed since created}

Promotable entries:
  {list of decision/spec-candidate/pitfall/insight entries}
```

### 3. Promote entries

If promotable entries exist, user prompt:

- Option 1: "Promote to spec" — short coding/arch/test constraint
- Option 2: "Promote to knowhow" — detailed recipe/template/decision/tip
- Option 3: "Promote both" — spec index entry + knowhow document
- Option 4: "Skip — nothing to promote"

**Routing by selection:**

| Selection | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Spec | `Skill("spec-add", args)` — guide user through category + content |
| Knowhow | `Skill("manage-knowhow-capture", args)` — guide through type + content |
| Both | `Skill("spec-add")` first, then `Skill("manage-knowhow-capture")` |
| Skip | Proceed to step 4 |

Update frontmatter: `promoted_specs`, `promoted_knowhow` counts.

Extract any `todo` entries → write to `follow_up` in frontmatter.

Clear `.workflow/.scratchpad/.companion-active`.

### 4. Output accumulation reminder + routing

```
Knowledge accumulation reminders:
  Reusable pattern found?        /spec-add <category> "title" "content" --description "summary"
  Solved a complex problem?      /manage-knowhow-capture recipe "description"
  Made an architecture decision? /manage-knowhow-capture decision "description"
  Discovered a useful trick?     /manage-knowhow-capture tip "content"

Next steps:
  /maestro-next          — recommend next command
  /maestro "<intent>"    — route intent to full workflow
  /manage-status         — view project dashboard
```

---

## S_ROUTE — Skill Routing

### 1. Parse intent

Extract intent text from $ARGUMENTS after removing the `route` keyword.

### 2. Delegate to maestro-next

```
Skill("maestro-next", "<intent_text>")
```

Delegates intent routing to maestro-next, which recommends the best single command.
